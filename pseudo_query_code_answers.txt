1. Remove duplicates in a query response.

  remove_dups = Posts.uniq.pluck(:title)

  SELECT DISTINCT body
  FROM post;

2. Filter records using inequalities, pattern matching, ranges, boolean logic.

  filter = Posts.each do |post|
            if post.title.length > 10 
              return post
            else next
            end 
  filter = Posts.each do |post|
          if post.title = null
            next
          else
            return post
          end 
  filter = (0..Posts.length) do |post|
          if post.title /^Jack/
            return post
          else 
            next
          end

  SELECT * 
  FROM post 
  WHERE title LIKE '%Jack%';

  SELECT * 
  FROM post
  WHERE post.id > 3;

  SELECT * 
  FROM post
  WHERE post.id <> 5;

  SELECT * 
  FROM post 
  WHERE title != null;

  3. Sort records in a particular order.

    sort = Posts.order(:title, :desc)

    SELECT title
    FROM post
    SORT BY title;

  4. Limit number of records returned. 

    limit = return Posts.each{|i| if i >= 5}

    SELECT title 
    FROM post
    LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;

  5. group records into sections.
    titles = []
    bodies = []
    groups = Posts.each {|param| param = Posts[:title] ? titles.push : bodies.push }

    SELECT * 
    FROM posts
    GROUP BY title, body;

  6. count = Posts.length 

    SELECT COUNT(title) as title_count
    FROM post;

  7. Join tables using cross join, inner join, outer join.

      cross_join = Post.joins("CROSS JOIN posts ON comments")
      right_join = Post.joins("RIGHT JOIN posts ON comments")
      left_join = Comment.joins("LEFT JOIN comments ON posts")
      outer_join = Post.joins("OUTER JOIN posts ON comments JOIN user ON posts")

      SELECT * 
      FROM post
      CROSS JOIN comment
      ON comments.post_id = post.id;

      SELECT * 
      FROM post 
      RIGHT JOIN comment
      ON comments.post_id = post.id;

      SELECT * 
      FROM comment
      LEFT JOIN post 
      ON post.id = comments.post_id;

      SELECT * 
      FROM post
      OUTER JOIN comment
      ON comment.post_id = post.id
      OUTER JOIN user
      ON user.id = comment.user_id;
